STRUCTURE IN C :
they can have pointers,structures,arrays as members.
LIMITATION :
1.   C doesnt allow structures to be treated as built in data types
     For example:
     struct num
     {
      int num;
      float deci;
      };
struct num n1,n2,n3;
n1=n2+n3 is illegal in C. 

2. Data hiding is not supported,members of a structure are public
