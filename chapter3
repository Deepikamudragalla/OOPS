ansi c only first 32 characters,
c++ has no limit on name length -> all characters in name are significant.

L 'ab' wide-character constant.****(wide-char constant)

c++ data types are of 3 types:user-defined:str,union,class,enum
                              (basic or fundamental)built-in:integral,void,floating type
                              derived:array,fn,pointer,reference

void :
1st type: void func1(void)
2nd type: void*gp;(generic pointer)
          int *ip;
          gp=ip;//correct
           ip=gp;// correct in c wrong in c++
            ip=(int*)gp;
          *ip=*gp;//ILLEGAL as generic pointer cant be dereferenced
we can assign any type of pointer to void pointer without typecasting.
